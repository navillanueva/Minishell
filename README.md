# Minishell
Building a minishell for Operating Systems course in 2020.
This is a group project that was done with Alejandro Rivero and √Ångel Rojas

*Explanation*

The minishell is built with a capacity of up to 9 different commands. In the code there is a detailed commentary of every line (it is excessive) explaining what the program is doing.
Unfortunately, it is written in spanish as it is for a spanish course. Enjoy!
